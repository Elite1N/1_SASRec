# Attempting to implement SASRec as a term project.
2301491 - Popular Techniques in Recommender System Research

This project is heavily based on **pmixer** (Mr. Huang Zhan)'s work on implementing SASRec using PyTorch,
as found in this Github repository https://github.com/pmixer/SASRec.pytorch.
the original paper delve into utilizing Transformer technology for session-based recommendations: 
Also, we implemented 2 python script for visualizing improvement on evaluated model accuracy after training, 
and an example on how the trained model can be used for prediction using inference on checkpoints (.pth).
